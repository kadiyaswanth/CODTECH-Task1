OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project:Program an Arduino Board to blink an LED at specific interval.

Objective:

To make an LED (Light Emitting Diode) turn on and off repeatedly at a set interval.
Components:

Arduino Board: This is the microcontroller board that will control the LED. Popular choices include the Arduino Uno.
LED: The light source.
Resistor (220-330 ohms): This is crucial to limit the current flowing through the LED and prevent it from burning out.
Connecting Wires: To create the circuit connections.
Breadboard (Optional but recommended): A convenient way to prototype circuits without soldering.
Circuit:

Connect the LED:
The longer leg of the LED (anode, positive) is connected to a digital pin on the Arduino through the resistor.
The shorter leg of the LED (cathode, negative) is connected to the GND (ground) pin on the Arduino.
Connect the Resistor:
The resistor is placed between the LED's anode and the Arduino's digital pin. This limits the current to a safe level for the LED.

Key Concepts:

Digital Output: The Arduino sends a digital signal (either HIGH or LOW) to control the LED.
Current Limiting: The resistor is essential to protect the LED from excessive current.
Delay: The delay() function pauses the program execution for a specified duration.

This project is a great starting point for learning about Arduino programming, basic electronics, and how to control hardware with software.
