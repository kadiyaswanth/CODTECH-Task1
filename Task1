/*This is the code for blinking an LED light,and this is connected to an Arduino.
The first line remembers which pin the LED is plugged into.The setup() part runs only once when the Arduino starts up.
Inside setup(),it tells the arduinno that the choosen pin will be used to send electricity out to the LED.
The loop() part runs repeatedly,forever.Inside loop(),it first sends electricity to the LED,turning it on.
Then it pauses for one second.After the pause it stops sending electricity,turning the LED off.Then it pauses again for one second.
This on-off cycle repeats continuously,making the LED blink.*/
